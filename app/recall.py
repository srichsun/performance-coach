"""Semantic recall over past journal entries, backed by pgvector.

Each saved entry's text is embedded and stored in a pgvector collection that
lives in the same Postgres as the entries table. During a conversation the
coach can call search_past_entries to pull back the moments most related to
what the person is talking about now — that's the "understands you right now"
layer (episodic memory), separate from the plain-SQL day/wins queries.

PGVector needs a real Postgres with the vector extension, so the store is
built lazily on first use and mocked in tests (SQLite can't run it).
