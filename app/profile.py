"""Rolling user profile — the long-term memory layer ("gets to know you").

The other two memory layers look backward at individual moments: structured SQL
(entries) answers "what happened when", semantic recall (pgvector) finds "a
similar past moment". The profile is different — a short, always-current summary
of who this person *is*: their goals, habits, recurring worries, what triggers
them, what helps. An LLM condenses it from the journal and it's injected into
every conversation, so the coach steadily understands them better without ever
re-reading the whole history.

Fixed size on purpose: injected every turn, so it must not grow without bound.
