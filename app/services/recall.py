"""Semantic recall over the person's atomic facts, backed by pgvector.

Each fact pulled from an exchange (see app.services.facts) is embedded on its
own and stored in a pgvector collection alongside its category. During a
conversation the coach can call search_past_entries to pull back the facts most
related to what the person is talking about now — the "understands you right
now" layer (semantic memory), separate from the plain-SQL day queries.

Storing one vector per single-topic fact — rather than one per whole turn — is
the point: a search for "health" matches only the health fact, instead of being
diluted by the work and relationship threads that shared the same turn.

PGVector needs a real Postgres with the vector extension, so the store is built
lazily on first use and mocked in tests (SQLite can't run it).
