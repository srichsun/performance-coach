"""Who this person is, written from their own record.

The wins list answers "what did I do" — day by day, concrete, small. This
answers a harder question: "what does all of that say about me?"

An LLM reads the whole journal of wins and writes back a short passage in
plain prose. Not a list of capabilities (too clinical, too easy to skim past)
— a few paragraphs that sound like someone who knows you, reminding you what
you're actually like when things are hard. It's meant to be read on the days
you've forgotten.

Stored alongside the profile (same table, a suffixed key) because it is the
same idea: a bounded, LLM-condensed view of a person, rewritten as the
journal grows.
