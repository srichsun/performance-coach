"""The life-coach agent, built on LangChain.

LangChain's create_agent gives us the whole "call the model, run any tools,
loop until it's done" cycle for free, so we don't hand-write that loop anymore.
Conversation memory is handled by a checkpointer keyed on the session id:
same id -> same remembered conversation.

The coach has one tool, search_past_entries, which lets it recall relevant
past journal entries mid-conversation (semantic memory over pgvector).
