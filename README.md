**A voice AI friend for the hard days.** You talk; she listens.

Minerva is built for the moments that actually derail a day — when fear takes
over, when nothing feels clear enough to decide, when you've lost sight of what
you're capable of. She steadies you, helps you think it through, and reminds
you what your own record already proves — so you get back to calm, and back to
work.

The reason she can do that is **memory**. Unlike a stateless chatbot, she keeps
your whole story, and the technical core of this project is making that
possible: **three layers of memory** that let her carry an ever-growing history
while every prompt stays a fixed, bounded size — the cost and context never
blow up, no matter how long you use it.

## Why three layers of memory

A general chatbot forgets you the moment the tab closes. Feeding it your whole
history every turn is expensive and eventually overflows the context window.
Minerva splits memory into three layers, each answering a different question:

| Layer | Backed by | Answers | AI? |
|-------|-----------|---------|-----|
| **1. Structured log** | Postgres (plain SQL) | "What happened, and when?" — recall any day, in order | No AI, just SQL |
| **2. Semantic recall** | Atomic facts in pgvector | "What do I know that's relevant to *right now*?" — she pulls back individual facts, filed by category | An LLM splits each turn into facts; embeddings + vector search find them |
| **3. Rolling profile** | LLM-condensed summary | "Who is this person?" — goals, habits, triggers, what helps — injected into every reply | An LLM re-condenses it |

Every prompt is assembled as **profile + relevant recalled past + today's
context**. The journal in Postgres can grow forever; the prompt does not, because
layers 2 and 3 keep only a fixed slice of it. That rolling profile — Minerva
steadily learning who you are — is exactly what a stateless chatbot cannot do.

## Three design decisions worth explaining

**Memory is stored as atomic facts, not whole turns.** The first version
embedded each turn whole. That broke as soon as it met real use: someone
speaking for three minutes covers work, health and family in one breath, and
averaging all three into a single 1536-dimension vector means a search for
"health" gets diluted by the other two threads. Retrieval degraded into "find a
day that felt similar" rather than "find the relevant moment".

So each exchange is now split by an LLM into 5–10 single-topic facts, each filed
under one of nine fixed categories (`about me`, `preferences`, `people`,
`work & career`, `goals & aspirations`, `health & habits`, `beliefs`,
`patterns`, `wins`) and embedded on its own. The split is a rewrite, not a cut: "work
stalled but I ran anyway" becomes a standalone "keeps running even when
exhausted", which still makes sense when it is retrieved months later with no
surrounding context. At retrieval, similarity search runs *alongside* the
model's own judgement — the agent names the categories worth searching as a
tool argument, so the two narrow the field together.

Worth saying what this is *not* for: if the answer already sits in one passage
(documentation Q&A, a clause in a contract), plain chunk-and-embed is cheaper
and just as good. Extraction earns its cost only when the answer has to be
*assembled* from scattered evidence — which is exactly what "what am I like when
I'm under pressure?" requires.

**There is no conversation-memory component.** An earlier version kept a
LangGraph checkpointer so the agent could remember the current conversation.
It was removed: every exchange is already written to Postgres, so an in-memory
copy was a second source of truth that vanished on restart and never crossed
devices. Each turn now rebuilds today's conversation by replaying it from the
database. Deleting a component proved more about the design than adding a
framework would have.

**A "conversation" is defined as uid + day, not a browser session.** Nothing
identifies the browser, so the same conversation continues on any device the
person signs in from. Days are drawn in **Taiwan time** (`app/core/clock.py`) — a UTC
day boundary would cut the thread at 8am local, halfway through a morning.

## How a conversation flows

```
  you speak ──► gpt-4o-mini-transcribe (STT) ──► LangChain agent
                                                       │
             ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┐
             │ profile + mantras injected               │ search_past_entries tool  │
             │ (layer 3, every turn)                    │ → pgvector (layer 2)      │
             └─────────────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────┘
                                                       ▼
                                          gpt-5.3-chat-latest replies
                                                       │
                       ┌───────────────────────────────┴──────────────────┐
                       ▼                                                  ▼
              Google Cloud TTS                            save entry to Postgres (layer 1)
              reads it aloud                              + split into atomic facts, embed
                                                            each into pgvector (layer 2)
                                                          + periodically re-condense profile (layer 3)
```

So one exchange both **answers you now** and **feeds all three memory layers**
for next time.

## What's under the hood

- **Voice in** — OpenAI **`gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`** turns your recorded audio
  into text. The browser reports its own recording format (Chrome makes webm,
  iOS Safari makes mp4) rather than the code assuming one.
- **Minerva** — a LangChain agent (`create_agent`) driven by **OpenAI
  `gpt-5.3-chat-latest`**, with a single `search_past_entries` tool it calls on
  its own whenever recalling a past moment would help. The tool takes an
  optional list of categories, so the model narrows the search itself instead of
  relying on vector distance alone. Claude is a supported alternative: set
  `LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic`. Profile and saved mantras are injected each turn via
  a dynamic prompt.
- **Fact extraction** — after each reply is sent, one small structured-output
  call breaks the exchange into single-topic facts and files each under a fixed
  category (`app/services/facts.py`). It runs off the reply path, so it costs
  the person no waiting. `scripts/backfill_facts.py` does the same for entries
  written before facts existed, carrying each entry's original date across.
- **Voice out** — the reply is read aloud with **Google Cloud TTS**
  (`en-GB-Chirp3-HD-Callirrhoe`, a genuinely British voice). ElevenLabs and
  OpenAI TTS sit behind the same `speak()` call via `TTS_PROVIDER`. Synthesis
  latency grows superlinearly with length, so the frontend splits the reply
  into ~220-character sentences and plays each while fetching the next — the
  first sound arrives in about a second.
- **Accounts** — **Firebase Auth (Google sign-in)** in the browser. The backend
  verifies the ID token with the Firebase Admin SDK and scopes every entry,
  every recall, and the profile to that one person. Every endpoint except
  `/health` requires sign-in.
- **Observability** — **LangSmith** traces every chain and agent call.

## What you can do with her

| Feature | What it is |
|---------|------------|
| **Talk** | Voice or text, streamed back token by token and read aloud. |
| **Mantra** | Lines you keep for yourself. Full CRUD, and they are injected into her prompt so she can use your own words back at you. |

## Privacy

The public repo, the showcase page, and the deployed demo use **seed / fake data
only**. Real journal entries stay on your machine and are gitignored, no API keys
live in the repo, and every costly endpoint is gated behind sign-in — so
nobody spends your keys or reads your journal.

## Tech stack

| Piece | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Web framework | **FastAPI** | Async, type hints, auto Swagger docs; light for an API. |
| Packaging | **uv** | One tool for venv + lockfile, far faster than pip/poetry. |
| Orchestration | **LangChain** | Agent + RAG + memory in one industry-standard stack, instead of hand-rolling the tool loop. |
| LLM | **OpenAI** `gpt-5.3-chat-latest` | The family that powers ChatGPT itself; Claude swappable via `LLM_PROVIDER`. |
| Speech-to-text | **OpenAI** `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` | Newer and more accurate than `whisper-1` at a similar price. |
| Text-to-speech | **Google Cloud TTS** | Real British accent, generous free tier; ElevenLabs / OpenAI behind the same call. |
| Journal store | **Postgres + pgvector** | One database holds the entries, the extracted facts, and their vectors (LangChain `PGVector`). |
| Embeddings | **OpenAI** `text-embedding-3-small` | One vector per atomic fact, so a search matches a single topic. |
| Auth | **Firebase Auth** (Google) | No passwords handled here; per-user scoping from a verified uid. |
| Tracing | **LangSmith** | Every chain/agent call is traced. |
| Frontend | **React (Vite)** | Chat and Mantra screens with mic recording + spoken replies. |
| Lint | **ruff** | Lint and format in one fast tool. |
| CI/CD | **GitHub Actions** | ruff + pytest on every push; green main deploys itself. |
| Deploy | **Google Cloud** | Cloud Run + Cloud SQL (Postgres + pgvector) + Secret Manager. |

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| GET  | `/health`            | — | Liveness check; no key needed. |
| POST | `/agent`             | ✅ | Typed chat. `{"question"}` → reply; the exchange is saved as a journal entry. |
| POST | `/agent/stream`      | ✅ | Same as `/agent`, but streams the reply token by token. |
| POST | `/transcribe`        | ✅ | Upload recorded audio → text. |
| POST | `/speak`             | ✅ | Text → spoken audio (mp3) for the browser to play. |
| GET  | `/entries?day=`      | ✅ | Recall one day's entries (`YYYY-MM-DD`, defaults to today, Taiwan time). |
| GET  | `/profile`           | ✅ | The long-term profile Minerva has built about you. |
| POST | `/profile/refresh`   | ✅ | Force a re-condense of the profile (normally automatic every few entries). |
| GET  | `/mantras`           | ✅ | The lines you've kept. |
| POST | `/mantras`           | ✅ | Keep a new line. |
| PATCH | `/mantras/{id}`     | ✅ | Reword one. |
| DELETE | `/mantras/{id}`    | ✅ | Drop one. |

Protected endpoints expect `Authorization: Bearer <Firebase ID token>`.

## Web UI

The React (Vite) frontend in `frontend/` has two screens — chat
and Mantra — behind a Google sign-in gate. With the API running, start it in a
second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:5173
```

It talks to the API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (allowed via CORS). In
production the same React build is served by FastAPI itself, from the image.

## Schema changes

Schema is versioned with **Alembic**. Change a model, then:

```bash
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "what changed"   # writes the migration
uv run alembic upgrade head                                # applies it
uv run alembic downgrade -1                                # undoes it
uv run alembic check                                       # models vs database
```

The app runs `alembic upgrade head` on boot, so a deploy migrates itself and a
fresh database builds from empty.

`migrations/env.py` hides LangChain's `langchain_pg_*` tables from autogenerate.
They aren't in `Base.metadata` because LangChain creates them, so without that
filter every migration would try to drop them — and every embedding with them.

## Tests and lint

```bash
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
```

The LLM, voice, and vector store are mocked and the suite runs against in-memory
SQLite, so it needs no API key and no running Postgres.

## Deploy

Pushing to `main` deploys itself: GitHub Actions runs ruff + pytest, and on
green it builds and rolls out to Cloud Run. It authenticates with **Workload
Identity Federation** — GitHub proves its identity with a short-lived OIDC
token and Google returns a short-lived credential, so no service-account key
exists anywhere.

`scripts/deploy_gcp.sh` provisions the whole thing from scratch on **Google
Cloud**: a Cloud Run service for the API, **Cloud SQL** (Postgres with pgvector)
for the journal and vectors, and **Secret Manager** for every key and the
Firebase service account. Run it after `gcloud auth login`.
